templates are html files rendered by views

template tags provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process.
Tags are surrounded by {% and %} like this: {% csrf_token %}
link to built in tag reference https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#ref-templates-builtins-tags

to keep things modular and reusable, a {% block name %} can used. blocks can be seen as a place on the base html document
where you want to put other contents later. see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#template-inheritance.
