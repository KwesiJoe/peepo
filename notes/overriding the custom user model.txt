Django uses the manager-managed pattern for user management.

The UserManager class is used in the creation, deleting and updating a user object.

the hierachy for the user manager is:

BaseManager -> Manager -> BaseUserManager -> UserManager


The default user object also has this hierachy:

models.Model -> AbstractBaseUser -> AbstractUser -> User


and by default AUTH_USER_MODEL - which captures the model to use to represent a User - is set to 'auth.User'

NB: an object can be imported from another namespace that imports it.
